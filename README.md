# Introduction

In week six of the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp we were challenged to develop a full-stack web site using HTML, CSS, Node.js Express, Handlebars and MongoDB. Together with [William Campbell](https://github.com/WilliamCampbellie) I built a musician's website using MongoDB for content managment. The site comprises multiple pages allowing tour dates, projects and recordings to be showcased as well as a basic blog and simple web shop. Separate pages provide an interface for the webmaster to manage content.

## The challenges

The main challenges developing this project were:
* Getting to grips with Git in a multi-developer situation and deling with merge conflicts
* Keeping track of the various routes for front-end rendering and database management
* Rendering of dates - not an issue we managed to solve during the time available

# What could be better

There are a number of changes I intend to introduce when updating this project:
* Move to a front-end framework (probably React)
* Combine the public and site maintenance views rather than having completely separate pages. This will improve the overall structure and maintenance components can be toggled based on the authorisation module
* Straemline some aspects of the data models. Introduce a markup editor and image hosting (possibly Cloudinary) for content maintenance.
* Improve the overall design and correct the rendering of dates
* Re-implement Paypal for webshop functionality
* Add the Shopify API to allow record samples to be heard
* Possibly add a Facebook feed panel.

## Conclusion
It was interesting to build my first 'real' website and get a feeling for the level of complexity it can create. My design skills need some work and I definately learned a lot about structuring a web site - hence the long list of improvements. I look forward to turining this into a 'real' site in the future.
